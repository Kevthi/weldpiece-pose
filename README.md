# Weldpiece Pose Datasets

This repository is based on the work of Ola Aalstad. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/olaals/weldpiece-pose-datasets.git). This fork will be used for manual ground truth labeling. All credits go to him.

The only difference is is that this will consist of documentation.
